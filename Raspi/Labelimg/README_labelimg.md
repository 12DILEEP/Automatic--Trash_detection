## Create Object Detection Datasets with Raspberry Pi and labelImg
# Introduction
In the [previous tutorial](https://gpiocc.github.io/learn/raspberrypi/ml/2020/04/18/martin-ku-using-raspberry-pi-and-tensorflow-lite-for-object-detection.html), we use TensorFlow Lite and pre-trained models to perform object detection on Raspberry Pi. Wouldn’t it be nice if we can train our own object detection models? While we don’t have something like the [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train) for object detection, we still can train custom object detection models relatively easily with the new [TensorFlow Lite Model Maker](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/models/modify/model_maker/object_detection).
