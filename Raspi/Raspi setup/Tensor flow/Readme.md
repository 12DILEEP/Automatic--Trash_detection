## Introduction

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been a hot topic for the past few years. There are many applications of AI. For example, your smartphone uses AI to recognize your face in photos, interpret your spoken commands and give suggestions to you when you search for something. AI technologies generally make inferences with abstract models that are generated by analyzing many sample data .

In particular, artificial neural network (ANN) is a form of AI models behind many AI technologies. ANN can handle a wide variety of tasks. Other than the computer vision and speech recognition technologies aforementioned, ANN can also be used for translation, playing board games and perform medical diagnosis. If you want to know more about the mathematics behind ANN, I strongly recommend you to [watch this excellent series of videos from 3blue1brown on Youtube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi)

On the other hand, [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is a software library for creating AI models. We can create, train and use ANN models with TensorFlow without dealing with the complex mathematics (at least at the beginning). You may understand more about TensorFlow by [watching some of their YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0rqucBdTuFTjJiefW5t-IQ)

However, creating AI models from the scratch may also be complicated. Luckily, there are many pre-trained models that we can use for different purposes. For instance, there are a number of image recognition AI models that can be used right out of the box.

In this tutorial, we will use some pre-trained models to perform object detection with the TensorFlow Lite library on a Raspberry Pi. The TensorFlow Lite library has been optimized for running on mobile devices or even microcontrollers. Specifically, we will:

setup a Python Virtual Environment for a Python project
install TensorFlow Lite runtime on Raspberry Pi
take a look of an object detection program

## Materials and Tools

 * Raspberry Pi (the model 4B+ is recommended)
 * Camera module for Raspberry Pi


## Connect and Configure the Raspberry Pi Camera Module

If this is the first time you use the Raspberry Pi camera module, you need to connect the camera module to the Raspberry Pi, as well as enable the camera interface on Raspbian OS. Before powering up the Raspberry Pi, connect the camera module to the Raspberry Pi.

The camera module should come with a CSI cable. Plug the cable to the Raspberry Pi and the camera module as shown below.

The metalic side of the cable should be in contact with the metalic part of the connectors on the Raspberry Pi and the camera modules

>>NOTE: If you find that the cable is too short, you may purchase a longer one on the Internet.

After the Raspberry Pi is booted, we need to enable the camera interface. First, we need to launch the `raspi-config` program in the terminal

>>pi@raspberrypi:~$ sudo raspi-config

Then, move down to ‘Interface Options’ and press ENTER.

Then, select ‘Yes’.

After going back to the main menu, select ‘Finish’ to close the raspi-config program. You need to reboot your Raspberry Pi

## Setup Python Virtual Environment

We need to install a number of Python libraries to get TensorFlow Lite working. While we can use `pip3` to install those Python libraries in the system, this is actually not recommended. Different projects may require different versions of Python libraries, and installing or upgrading those Python libraries may break the existing projects. Fortunately, Python Virtual Environment allows us to create separate spaces for different projects to install Python libraries.

First, we check whether the latest version of `python3-venv` has been installed. If not, we need to install or update that.

>>`pi@raspberrypi`:~$ sudo apt update

>>`pi@raspberrypi`:~$ sudo apt install python3-venv

Then, we create a folder `ai` for our project, and navigate to the folder.
>>pi@raspberrypi:~$ mkdir -p ~/ai && cd ~/ai

Next, we create a virtual environment named `tfl` for our project.
>>`pi@raspberrypi`:~/ai$ python3 -m venv tfl

After the command is executed, a new folder `tfl` is created. The folder will contain all the Python libraries that can be used only if you activate this specific virtual environment. Everytime we activate the tfl virtual environment, we need to execute the `tfl/bin/activate` file with the source command.

>>NOTE: If you need to use the system packages (e.g. the RPi.GPIO library), you should add the flag `--system-site-packages`.

>>`pi@raspberrypi`:~/ai$ source tfl/bin/activate

From now, `(tfl)` will be shown in every line you enter in the terminal.


When we create a new virtual environment, we should always update the `pip` module inside the virtual environment first.

>>(tfl) `pi@raspberrypi`:~/ai$ pip install --upgrade pip

We are now ready to install the TensorFlow Lite runtime.
